## Collaboration Agreement

### Logistical

1. What hours will you be available to communicate: 1200-2400EST // 0900-2100PST
2. What platform will we use to communicate: Slack/Phone
3. How often will we take breaks: As needed (minimum 10 mins per hour)
4. What is our plan if we start to fall behind: Identify roadblocks and work together to solve and get TA assistance if necessary.

### Cooperative

1. List of each person's strengths
    Jon: Experience with software design structure
    Wasim: Front-end/Presentation/Organization
2. How can we best utilize these strengths: Jon will ensure our project maintains a forward minded build. Wasim will ensure all project tasks are managed.
3. In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength: Jon wants to improve front end understanding. Wasim wants to improve overall program flow.
4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development: We will touch base every day with the plan and the conclusion.

### Conflict Resolution

1. What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing: We will attempt to resolve 1 on 1, but either party will contact instructor or TA if unable to resolve the issues.
2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other contribute: same as above. We will engage with an understanding that each other's contributions deserve the respect of being a part of the project.
3. How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and in skill level: should either of us feel as though we do not understand what the other is saying/developing we will work to learn together and improve our mutual understanding of the concepts at hand.
